- CSS rules to handle:
  - Box model: paddings and margins
  - CSS Selectors: by tag name, by class
  - CSS rules: background, box-shadow, border, color, width, height
  - Typographies: You will need to use 'Roboto' font family

About team-work and collaboration:
By doing 'pair programming' we are not only evaluating your technical skills but also your soft skills.
It is very important that you show your ability to:

- Be a team player.
- Communicate your ideas effectively
- Value the learning process.
- Face obstacles with perseverance and optimism.

You can check the internet for help but try to not just copy-paste some code that you doesn't understand.

Use Figma (the design tool) to check some values like distances between elements, colors and more.
Try to deliver a card that matches as close as posible the given design.
